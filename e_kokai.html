Ikeda Toshio (a former Fujitsu executive officer) was one of the 
central figures in the development of Japan's computer industry. He was 
also an avid go player.

When he was a general manager at Fujitsu, Ikeda was made one of the 
planners of the Osaka Exposition. One of his ideas was to have visitors 
play go against a computer as an event at the exposition. This idea 
quickly proved to be impractical, however. To begin with, a go-playing 
computer needs a completely logical set of rules.</TD></TR>

While studying the rules of go, Ikeda learned that the Laws of Go used 
at that time by Japan's professional go association (the Nihon Ki-in) 
were not necessarily logical, being little more than a reformulation of 
customs that had come down from the Tokugawa period. He also recognized that 
the Chinese and Japanese rules sometimes gave different results. Later, 
he devised a logical set of rules that would eliminate the 
differences between the Chinese and Japanese results.<BR><BR>

Ikeda had a dream of go as an international game. Go is a form of 
nonverbal communication, and he wanted to spread this excellent game 
throughout the world. That would require international rules logical 
enough to be accepted in western countries, and usable in games with 
Chinese players.<BR><BR>

With the assistance of Go Seigen (9 dan), Rin Kaiho (9 dan), and 
Miyamoto Naoki (then 8 dan, now 9 dan), Ikeda restudied the existing 
material and published a one-year series of articles on the rules of go 
in <I>Igo Shincho</I>. <BR><BR>
Most of the defects of the Japanese rules that Ikeda pointed out have 
been remedied by the current official Japanese Rules of Go, but Ikeda's 
approach to the study of the rules is still valid.<BR><BR>

Fujitsu has realized Ikeda's dream in the form of the Fujitsu Cup. The 
Fujitsu Cup started a surge in international go activity. There are now 
many international tournaments, sponsored in different countries.<BR><BR>

There is also talk of making go an Olympic sport. Now is the time when 
the rules of go need to receive attention, to make go truly 
international. Ikeda's study of the rules is still fresh, and we think 
that if offers a good basis for the fair pursuit of further discussions.<BR><BR>

The entire text of the study has been made available on this web site 
through the kind permission of Ikeda Sizu, the widow of Ikeda Toshio.<BR><BR>
