<TD>If these explanations are correct, however, they should follow naturally from playing the position out. They do not. They are unnatural explanations that one must resort to when both sides refuse to play first. If both sides are allowed to refuse to play first, a rigorous demonstration that any explanation is correct becomes impossible. The Japanese practice is to let the game end as in Dia. 2-12-9 and give White three points. If another black stone is added, as in Dia. 2-12-10, then White gets two additional points. Dia. 2-12-10 is therefore regarded as five points of territory for White.

This practice is endorsed by the precedents of the Nihon Kiin. Under area rules (described later) the position can also be worth three points, with the noteworthy feature that this conclusion is arrived at in a natural way. The question of three points without capturing is important in showing the character of a set of rules, because with some rules it can also become two points.
