Nearly all go players feel the profound attraction of go, that increases the more deeply they come to know the game. In its limitless variations, which arise from utterly natural and simple principles (rules), you can find expressions of an extremely human nature: of deep logical thought processes, of judgements reflecting broad and careful consideration, and of human emotions. To look at the many great games into which players have poured their souls, to see the passion with which they played, and to observe the way they struggled toward truth is one of the greatest pleasures a go player can experience. Since this excellent game was created and developed in the Orient, we who play it have a special interest in creating rational rules for it and spreading it to other countries.
